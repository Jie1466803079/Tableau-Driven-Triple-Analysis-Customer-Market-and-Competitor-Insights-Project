# Tableau-Driven-Triple-Analysis-Customer-Market-and-Competitor-Insights-Project
In this project, I used a structured approach based on the Big Data Analytics Lifecycle to analyze the provided datasets. Initial data exploration was undertaken to pinpoint crucial attributes, followed by the execution of ETL processes for data cleansing. Once the data was cleaned, I built a Tableau dashboard to extract valuable insights about customer behaviors during weekdays/weekends, customer segmentation, and a competitor comparison based on market share. These insights can assist Outdoor in formulating strategic decisions to bolster sales growth.
